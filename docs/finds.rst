Finds
=====

Another way to handle dynamic pages where the number of elements is not defined is ``Finds`` class.
It works the same way as ``Find`` with the same parameters but returns list of elements.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/8_finds.py

And you can even have a dynamic list of typed elements.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/9_finds_ui_type.py
